                <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
                <p>This report provides an in-depth analysis of the operating rate changes of major PTA, MEG, and polyester plants in the Asia-Pacific region in Q1 2026, as well as the impact of new capacity on supply-demand balance. The report indicates that the concentrated commissioning of multiple large-scale plants will have a significant impact on the market landscape.</p>

                <h2>1. PTA Plant Operating Rate Analysis</h2>
                <p>In Q1 2026, the overall operating rate of PTA plants in the Asia-Pacific region remained at 83.5%, up 2.3 percentage points from the same period last year. The main reasons include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Multiple large-scale PTA plants in China's coastal areas completed scheduled maintenance around the Spring Festival, with operating loads gradually increasing</li>
                    <li>New capacity of 2 million tons/year in Southeast Asia was commissioned, offsetting some of the retired capacity from older plants</li>
                    <li>Relatively stable downstream polyester demand provided support for PTA operations</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>2. MEG Capacity Expansion Trends</h2>
                <p>The MEG market will experience significant capacity expansion in 2026, with an expected annual addition of 3.5 million tons, mainly distributed in the following regions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>East China:</strong> Planned commissioning of 1.5 million tons/year coal-to-MEG capacity</li>
                    <li><strong>Middle East:</strong> Two large-scale integrated plants will contribute 1.2 million tons/year capacity</li>
                    <li><strong>Southeast Asia:</strong> 800,000 tons/year naphtha-based MEG plant expected to start up in Q2</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>3. Polyester Industry Chain Supply-Demand Balance</h2>
                <p>From the perspective of the overall industry chain, the supply-demand dynamics of the PTA-MEG-Polyester value chain are undergoing subtle changes:</p>
                
                <h3>Supply Side</h3>
                <p>Upstream feedstock PX supply is relatively ample, with commissioning of Asian refining-petrochemical integrated projects providing sufficient feedstock for PTA production. For MEG, capacity expansion via the coal-to-MEG route is accelerating, with the cost curve continuing to shift downward.</p>

                <h3>Demand Side</h3>
                <p>Downstream polyester product demand shows divergence. Textile-grade polyester staple fiber demand is affected by seasonal fluctuations in terminal apparel orders, while industrial-grade polyester filament maintains steady growth due to infrastructure and automotive sector demand.</p>

                <h3>Spread Changes</h3>
                <p>The PX-PTA spread in Q1 maintained in the range of 800-900 yuan/ton, below historical averages. The PTA-MEG spread has narrowed somewhat due to increased MEG supply, currently fluctuating between 2,200-2,400 yuan/ton.</p>

                <h2>4. Market Outlook for 2026</h2>
                <p>Considering the pace of capacity commissioning, demand growth expectations, and cost-side changes, we make the following assessments for the 2026 market:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>PTA Market:</strong> Supply-demand balance relatively balanced, price center expected to rise slightly from 2025</li>
                    <li><strong>MEG Market:</strong> Supply pressure intensifying, prices may face downward risks</li>
                    <li><strong>Polyester Market:</strong> Value chain profits shifting downstream, polyester producer profitability expected to improve</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>5. Risk Factors</h2>
                <p>Key risk factors to monitor include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Impact of crude oil price volatility on industry chain cost structure</li>
                    <li>New capacity commissioning progress being ahead or behind expectations</li>
                    <li>Global economic slowdown leading to terminal demand decline</li>
                    <li>Impact of trade policy changes on regional supply-demand patterns</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>The PTA-MEG-Polyester industry chain in 2026 will enter a new development phase, with the interplay between capacity expansion and demand growth determining market direction. Companies need to closely monitor plant commissioning progress, operating rate changes, and cost curve shifts, flexibly adjusting business strategies to seize opportunities amid market changes.</p>
